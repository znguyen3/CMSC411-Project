How to run code:
-First download the repository with the simulator cpp file, the data segment file representing memory,
 an instruction file containing sample MIPS assembly instructions, and a makefile.
-Then navigate to that directory in a terminal with gcc, g++, and make installed.
-Once you are in that directory, type "make" and hit enter.

Execution Syntax: "./simulator inst.txt data_segment.txt output.txt"  

Executing the line above will create a file output.txt, containing the information gained from the simulator.
